The trick is to split our labelled data, prior to training, into a so-called *training* and *test* sets. The data and labels of the training set are visible to the classified and used for the actual training, while the test set remains hidden during that time. Once the classifier is trained, it will have to predict labels for the test set data. These predicted labels will be compared to the known ground-truth ones, thus providing an estimation of the predictive power of the trained algorithm. \n",
